# I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://econ.unc.edu/graduate). My research interests center on Applied Microeconomics, with a particular focus on Labor, Health, and Development Economics. My current research explores parent-child dynamics, early childhood development, and parental substance use and conviction.


# Before beginning my Ph.D. program at UNC Chapel Hill, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Statistics from the [University of Ghana](https://www.ug.edu.gh), followed by a Master’s degree in Applied Economics from [UNC Greensboro](https://bryan.uncg.edu/departments/department-of-economics/). My academic journey has been driven by a deep curiosity about the intersection of economic policies and human well-being. I am passionate about conducting research that uses advanced applied econometric techniques across various fields of economics to provide evidence-based solutions to pressing societal challenges.
