I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://econ.unc.edu/graduate). My research interests center on Applied Microeconomics, with a particular focus on Labor, Health, and Development Economics. My current research explores parent-child dynamics, early childhood development, and parental substance use and conviction.


Before beginning my Ph.D. program at UNC Chapel Hill, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Statistics from the [University of Ghana](https://www.ug.edu.gh), followed by a Master’s degree in Applied Economics from [UNC Greensboro](https://bryan.uncg.edu/departments/department-of-economics/). My academic journey has been driven by a deep curiosity about the intersection of economic policies and human well-being. I am passionate about conducting research that uses advanced applied econometric techniques across various fields of economics to provide evidence-based solutions to pressing societal challenges.

I am also a short-term consultant at the World Bank’s Enterprise Analysis Unit, which conducts the World Bank Enterprise Survey ([WBES](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/enterprisesurveys)). The WBES are nationally representative firm-level surveys with top managers and owners of businesses in over 150 economies, reaching 180 in upcoming years, that provide insight into many business environment topics such as access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, and performance, among others.
