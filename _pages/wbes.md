## World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES)
World Bank Enterprise Surveys (WBES) are nationally representative firm-level surveys with top managers and owners of businesses in over 150 economies, reaching 180 in upcoming years, that provide insight into many business environment topics such as access to finance, corruption, infrastructure, and performance, among others.

The World Bankâ€™s Enterprise Analysis Unit is a team of economists and firm-level survey experts that: 
  - conducts Enterprise Surveys and 

  - draws upon this wealth of firm-level data to produce research on the micro-economic foundations of growth.
