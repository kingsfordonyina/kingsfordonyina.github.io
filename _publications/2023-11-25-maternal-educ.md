### Abstract
This paper investigates the effects of mother’s education on child malnutrition in selected West African countries; Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast. As the early years of every individual’s life are the most essential stage of their life, one of the most important factors that pave the way for their survival and growth during childhood is their levels of nutrition. Since mothers are the primary caregivers, recent studies have demonstrated the importance of maternal education on child health across both developed and developing countries. This study utilizes the most recent versions of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHSs) of Ghana, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast and employed the ordered probit models and finds that in all three cases, maternal education is important in combating child malnutrition, particularly with long term malnutrition (stunting). Results also suggest that higher educational attainment poses high benefits on child malnutrition compared to lower levels implying the need to encourage females to pursue higher education. Additionally, mass media exposure and investment in human capital by African governments are imperative. This paper provides empirical evidence that outlines the influence of mothers’ education on their children’s health status. Thus, it helps in understanding the most essential form of child malnutrition across the three West African countries considered, filling the gap in the extant literature.
